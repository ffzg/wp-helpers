### Additional Nginx Whitelist Considerations

During the analysis of WordPress plugins, it was discovered that some plugins or their included libraries might create admin pages using files not initially present in a basic hardened Nginx configuration's whitelist.

**Example:**
The `fluentform` plugin includes the `Action Scheduler` library, which creates an admin page accessible via `tools.php?page=action-scheduler`. To ensure this page functions correctly, `tools.php` must be added to the Nginx whitelist for `wp-admin` files.

**Action:**
If a plugin's admin page is inaccessible, check its `add_*_page` function calls to identify the base PHP file used (e.g., `admin.php`, `options-general.php`, `tools.php`). If this file is not whitelisted in your Nginx configuration, add it to the appropriate `location` block.
